# ReactPortfolio_SocialNetwork

This is my first project made during learning of React. It is an example of social network with different features implemented.

After cloning the project do "npm install" before "npm start" to install all the dependencies.
Thus it is my first project and some of the codecs and libraries used in it are outdated.
